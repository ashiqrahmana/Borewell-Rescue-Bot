# Borewell-Rescue-Bot

## **Overview**
The Borewell Rescue Bot is an innovative robotic system designed to rescue individuals, particularly children, who have fallen into borewells or manholes. This project aims to develop a fully functional robot capable of safely extracting individuals from such hazardous situations with minimal injuries. The bot incorporates mechanical, electronic, and control systems to perform the rescue operation efficiently and effectively.

## **Features**
**Mechanical Aspect**: The robot utilizes a combination of eight actuators to achieve various functions. These actuators include a lead screw and jack mechanism, high torque geared motors, lead screw mechanisms, and a 3-slider parallel manipulator. These components enable precise control over the bot's movements and positioning during the rescue operation.

**Electronic Aspect**: The robot's control system is based on Arduino, which provides wireless control for simplicity and convenience. It utilizes several electronic components such as HC-12 for wireless communication, relays for motor control, gas and pressure sensors for safety monitoring, ultrasonic sensors for distance calculation, temperature sensors for environmental measurements, infrared cameras for visibility, and induction proximity sensors for accurate positioning.

**Working Procedure**: The rescue process involves lowering the robot into the borewell or manhole using cables. The robot's actuators perform various operations such as securing the bot to the wall, rotating the bot, controlling the vertical position of the cage structure, expanding or contracting the cage structure, manipulating the end effector to capture the child's head or hands, and applying vibrations to reduce friction. Once the child is secured, the cage structure is closed, and the bot is lifted slowly and steadily to ensure the child's safety.

## Implementation and Timeline
**Research and Analysis**: Conduct further analysis and simulation of the prototype (Version-1 bot) using software tools like ANSYS and Inventor Pro. Study existing rescue bots to gather insights for Version-2 development.

**Design Phase**: Design and develop the research and oxygen supply bot, cage structure, head jack, parallel manipulator, and other required actuators. Ensure a modular design for easy assembly.

**Component Selection**: Research and finalize the components needed for the bot, considering pricing and availability.

**Building Phase**: Start building the bot, integrating the mechanical, electronic, and control systems. Continuously refine and fine-tune the system during the 6-month construction period.

**Electrical and Software Integration**: Incorporate the electrical and electronic components into the bot, ensuring proper functionality. Develop and integrate the required software codes for control and operation.

**Testing and Tuning**: Perform extensive lab testing to verify the performance and functionality of the bot. Fine-tune both the hardware and software components based on test results.

**Field Testing**: Conduct testing in a real borewell or manhole scenario using dummy objects. Continuously refine and fine-tune the system based on field testing results.

**Finalization and Transportation**: Complete the testing phase, finalize the total system, and prepare a transportation system to transfer the bot to the rescue site.

## Expected Outcomes
The successful development of the Borewell Rescue Bot will result in a highly effective and reliable robotic system for rescuing individuals from borewells and manholes. The bot's ability to perform precise movements, capture the child securely, and lift them safely will greatly minimize injuries and save valuable lives. The versatility of the bot also allows for potential applications in research, oil well surveillance, studying underground topology, and other commercial purposes.
